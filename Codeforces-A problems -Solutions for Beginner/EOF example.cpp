Problem : the problem is sometimes in the Q it mentions that you will have take input as many as
the user wishes so there is no fix or n type .

Solution:  to solve  these problems we will the end of file method here we'll use the
while loop and while loop will run until the user provides the input when the user is not
    providing the input anymore than the program will go to the next step.
